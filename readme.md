This repo contains my personal dotfiles and a WIP installer for both the dotfiles and my normal dev environment.

The installer is written in Python and use Curses to provide a fairly simple interactive UI to guide you through installation.

A granular custom installation is planned.

To run simply use `sudo bash install.sh` in the home directory. This bash script will ensure the machine and it's packages is up to date before running the UI based installer.
